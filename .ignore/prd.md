# Swift Travel Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform vague travel desires into specific, executable weekend plans using multi-agent AI coordination that delivers concierge-quality recommendations
- Eliminate generic recommendation fatigue by providing persona-driven curation (Photography, Food-Forward, Architecture, Family Explorer) that surfaces unique experiences
- Bridge the discovery-to-planning gap with actionable, time-aware, walkable itineraries that maximize limited weekend time
- Achieve product-market fit with 25% of users creating multiple itineraries within 30 days, demonstrating strong value alignment
- Generate sustainable revenue through premium subscriptions reaching $10K MRR within 8 months post-launch
- Maintain >4.5/5 user satisfaction rating on itinerary quality, significantly outperforming generic travel tools (<3.2/5)
- Become the definitive platform for premium weekend travel curation among culturally-aware, affluent travelers aged 25-45

### Background Context

Swift-travel builds directly on Cardinal's completed experimentation phase, leveraging proven multi-agent AI orchestration to solve critical failures in weekend travel planning. Traditional platforms like TripAdvisor and Google Travel surface identical tourist traps regardless of personal interests, while AI tools like ChatGPT produce soulless lists prone to hallucinations.

The market opportunity is validated through Cardinal's research showing 73% of weekend trips require 3+ hours of research across multiple platforms, with 40% of travelers reporting disappointment with generic recommendations. Swift-travel's multi-agent approach (Research + Curation + Validation + Response agents) produces measurably higher quality recommendations than single-model approaches, targeting sophisticated weekenders who value quality curation over tourist box-checking. The platform focuses on rapid MVP deployment using Cardinal's validated architecture while building toward a comprehensive travel intelligence platform with booking integration and community features.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Swift-travel's interface should feel like a sophisticated travel concierge in digital form - elegant, confidence-inspiring, and effortlessly intuitive. The design should convey premium curation quality while maintaining the speed and efficiency busy professionals demand. Visual hierarchy guides users from inspiration ("where should I go?") through curation ("what should I do?") to execution ("here's your plan") with clear value demonstration at each stage.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple destination/persona selection, then progressively reveal detailed itinerary components as users engage deeper
- **Card-Based Storytelling**: Each recommendation presented as a rich media card with local context, timing, and "why this matters" narrative
- **Swipe-to-Refine**: Mobile-native gestures for quick itinerary adjustments ("too touristy," "more adventurous," "different neighborhood")
- **Visual Timeline**: Day-by-day itinerary display with neighborhood clustering and travel time visualization
- **Export-First Design**: Every screen designed with sharing/saving in mind - clean, screenshot-worthy layouts

### Core Screens and Views
- **Persona Selection Screen**: Visual persona picker with Photography Weekend, Food-Forward Explorer, Architecture Enthusiast, Family Adventure options
- **Requirements Input Flow**: Guided questions for destination, dates, budget, interests with smart defaults and skip options
- **Destination Suggestion Cards**: AI-curated city/region recommendations with mood imagery and 1-sentence hooks
- **Itinerary Detail View**: Day-by-day timeline with expandable activity cards, neighborhood maps, and timing guidance
- **Refinement Chat Interface**: Conversational refinement with quick-action buttons for common adjustments
- **Export & Share Hub**: PDF generation, link sharing, and itinerary history management

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG AA compliance to ensure premium experience for all users, including proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for all imagery and interactive elements.

### Branding
Clean, sophisticated aesthetic reminiscent of premium travel publications (Conde Nast Traveler, Monocle Travel) with emphasis on high-quality photography, generous whitespace, and typography that conveys both trustworthiness and wanderlust. Color palette should feel timeless rather than trendy, with subtle luxury touches that reinforce the premium positioning without appearing ostentatious.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on mobile-responsive web experience optimized for iOS Safari and Android Chrome, with desktop support for planning sessions. No native app initially - mobile web provides faster iteration and broader accessibility while maintaining full functionality.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all Swift-travel components (web app, API, multi-agent orchestration, shared utilities) to enable rapid iteration and coordinated deployment during MVP phase. This supports the <20 second processing requirement by minimizing inter-service latency while maintaining clear separation of concerns within the monorepo structure.

### Service Architecture
**Multi-Agent Orchestration within Monolithic API**: Deploy Cardinal's validated four-agent system (Research, Curation, Validation, Response) as coordinated modules within a single API service. This architectural choice balances multi-agent coordination benefits with MVP deployment simplicity, avoiding microservices complexity while maintaining agent specialization. The monolithic approach ensures sub-20-second processing times and simplified error handling during early scaling.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing with Multi-Agent Validation**: Comprehensive testing pyramid including unit tests for individual agent logic, integration tests for agent coordination workflows, and end-to-end tests for complete user journeys. Special emphasis on testing multi-agent handoffs, external API integration (Google Places/Maps), and hallucination detection. Testing framework must support async agent coordination patterns and mock external API responses for reliable CI/CD pipelines.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Programming Language & Framework**: 
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript for rapid development, strong async support for multi-agent coordination, and seamless LLM API integration
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for mobile-responsive web experience, server-side rendering for SEO, and static export capabilities for PDF generation

**LLM Integration Strategy**: 
- Primary: OpenAI GPT-4 for agent coordination with fallback to Anthropic Claude for validation cross-checking
- Cost management through intelligent prompt optimization and response caching
- Agent-specific model selection (lighter models for validation, premium models for curation)

**External API Integration**:
- Google Places API for location validation and details
- Google Maps API for travel time calculation and neighborhood clustering
- Implement proper rate limiting, caching, and error handling to meet 99.5% uptime requirement

**Data Storage**:
- PostgreSQL for structured user data, itinerary storage, and audit trails
- Redis for session management, API response caching, and real-time agent coordination state

**Authentication & Security**:
- Magic link authentication with JWT tokens for stateless session management
- API key management for external services with proper rotation and monitoring
- Input sanitization and rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Deployment & Infrastructure**:
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment across environments
- CI/CD pipeline supporting rapid iteration while maintaining quality gates
- Cloud deployment (preferably AWS/Vercel) with auto-scaling for peak travel planning periods

**Monitoring & Analytics**:
- Application performance monitoring for multi-agent processing times
- User behavior analytics for conversion funnel optimization
- Error tracking and alerting for agent coordination failures
- Cost monitoring for LLM API usage against revenue targets
