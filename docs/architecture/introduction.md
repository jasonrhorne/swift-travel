# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Swift Travel, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, Swift Travel is a **greenfield project** building on Cardinal's validated multi-agent AI orchestration patterns. The project leverages proven architectural concepts from Cardinal's experimentation phase rather than using a specific starter template.

**Key architectural decisions inherited from Cardinal:**
- Multi-agent orchestration approach (Research, Curation, Validation, Response agents)
- <20 second processing time requirement
- Node.js/TypeScript technology foundation
- Monorepo structure for rapid MVP iteration

Since this is not based on a specific starter template, we have full architectural flexibility while building on proven multi-agent coordination patterns.
