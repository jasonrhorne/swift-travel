# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Swift-travel's interface should feel like a sophisticated travel concierge in digital form - elegant, confidence-inspiring, and effortlessly intuitive. The design should convey premium curation quality while maintaining the speed and efficiency busy professionals demand. Visual hierarchy guides users from inspiration ("where should I go?") through curation ("what should I do?") to execution ("here's your plan") with clear value demonstration at each stage.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple destination/persona selection, then progressively reveal detailed itinerary components as users engage deeper
- **Card-Based Storytelling**: Each recommendation presented as a rich media card with local context, timing, and "why this matters" narrative
- **Swipe-to-Refine**: Mobile-native gestures for quick itinerary adjustments ("too touristy," "more adventurous," "different neighborhood")
- **Visual Timeline**: Day-by-day itinerary display with neighborhood clustering and travel time visualization
- **Export-First Design**: Every screen designed with sharing/saving in mind - clean, screenshot-worthy layouts

## Core Screens and Views
- **Persona Selection Screen**: Visual persona picker with Photography Weekend, Food-Forward Explorer, Architecture Enthusiast, Family Adventure options
- **Requirements Input Flow**: Guided questions for destination, dates, budget, interests with smart defaults and skip options
- **Destination Suggestion Cards**: AI-curated city/region recommendations with mood imagery and 1-sentence hooks
- **Itinerary Detail View**: Day-by-day timeline with expandable activity cards, neighborhood maps, and timing guidance
- **Refinement Chat Interface**: Conversational refinement with quick-action buttons for common adjustments
- **Export & Share Hub**: PDF generation, link sharing, and itinerary history management

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG AA compliance to ensure premium experience for all users, including proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for all imagery and interactive elements.

## Branding
Clean, sophisticated aesthetic reminiscent of premium travel publications (Conde Nast Traveler, Monocle Travel) with emphasis on high-quality photography, generous whitespace, and typography that conveys both trustworthiness and wanderlust. Color palette should feel timeless rather than trendy, with subtle luxury touches that reinforce the premium positioning without appearing ostentatious.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on mobile-responsive web experience optimized for iOS Safari and Android Chrome, with desktop support for planning sessions. No native app initially - mobile web provides faster iteration and broader accessibility while maintaining full functionality.
