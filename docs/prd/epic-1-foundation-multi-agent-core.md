# Epic 1: Foundation & Multi-Agent Core

**Expanded Goal:** Establish Swift-travel's technical foundation and core multi-agent orchestration system that can intake user requirements and generate basic travel itineraries. This epic delivers immediate value by proving the multi-agent concept while building essential project infrastructure including authentication, database setup, and CI/CD pipeline. Upon completion, users can successfully input travel preferences and receive AI-generated weekend itineraries, demonstrating the platform's core value proposition.

## Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

As a developer,  
I want a fully configured development environment with CI/CD pipeline,  
so that the team can collaborate effectively and deploy confidently from day one.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure created with clear separation for web app, API, multi-agent system, and shared utilities
2. Node.js/TypeScript development environment configured with consistent linting, formatting, and testing setup
3. PostgreSQL database with initial schema for users, sessions, and itineraries
4. Redis instance configured for session management and agent coordination state
5. Docker containerization for all services with docker-compose for local development
6. CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, code quality checks, and staging deployment
7. Environment configuration management for development, staging, and production
8. Basic monitoring and logging infrastructure connected to application

## Story 1.2: Magic Link Authentication System

As a user,  
I want to access Swift-travel through secure magic link authentication,  
so that I can start planning travel without password friction while keeping my itineraries private.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Magic link email generation and delivery system with secure token creation
2. Token validation and JWT session creation upon magic link click
3. Session management with automatic renewal for active users
4. User profile creation with basic preferences storage (name, email)
5. Session-based itinerary ownership and retrieval
6. Logout functionality with proper session cleanup
7. Rate limiting on magic link requests to prevent abuse
8. Email template design for professional magic link delivery

## Story 1.3: Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine

As a system,  
I want to coordinate four specialized AI agents (Research, Curation, Validation, Response) in sequence,  
so that I can generate high-quality travel recommendations through collaborative AI processing.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Agent coordination framework with sequential processing pipeline
2. Research Agent implementation for destination discovery based on user requirements
3. Curation Agent implementation for itinerary creation with local context
4. Validation Agent implementation with basic Google Places API integration for verification
5. Response Agent implementation for user-friendly output formatting
6. Inter-agent data passing with proper error handling and state management
7. Processing time monitoring with alerts if coordination exceeds 20 seconds
8. Agent failure recovery mechanisms with graceful degradation

## Story 1.4: Basic Requirements Intake Flow

As a user,  
I want to input my travel preferences through a guided interface,  
so that the AI agents have sufficient information to create personalized itinerary recommendations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Clean, mobile-responsive form for destination, dates, and basic preferences
2. Input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data
3. Smart defaults and optional fields to reduce user friction
4. Progress indication for multi-step requirements gathering
5. Data persistence to user session for retrieval and modification
6. Clear value proposition messaging throughout the intake process
7. Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) for form interactions
8. Integration with multi-agent orchestration system for processing

## Story 1.5: Simple Itinerary Generation & Display

As a user,  
I want to receive a formatted weekend itinerary based on my requirements,  
so that I can evaluate Swift-travel's recommendation quality and plan my trip.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. End-to-end processing from user input through all four agents to final output
2. Basic itinerary display with day-by-day structure and activity recommendations
3. Processing status indicators during agent coordination (estimated time remaining)
4. Error handling for agent failures with user-friendly error messages
5. Itinerary storage associated with user session for retrieval
6. Basic mobile-responsive layout for itinerary viewing
7. Processing time measurement and logging for performance optimization
8. Success metrics tracking (completion rate, processing time, user satisfaction)
