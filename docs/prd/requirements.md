# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall orchestrate four specialized AI agents (Research, Curation, Validation, Response) to generate personalized weekend itineraries within 20 seconds end-to-end processing time.

**FR2:** The system shall accept user requirements through a guided hybrid input method (based on Cardinal's best-performing approach) with fallback options for different planning preferences.

**FR3:** The system shall generate itineraries through specialized persona lenses including Photography Weekend, Food-Forward Explorer, Architecture Enthusiast, and Family Adventure personas.

**FR4:** The Validation Agent shall cross-reference all recommendations against external APIs (Google Places/Maps) to verify accuracy, existence, and current operating hours before presenting to users.

**FR5:** The system shall produce mobile-first responsive itinerary displays with day-by-day timelines, neighborhood clustering, and reservation timing guidance.

**FR6:** The system shall provide PDF export functionality and shareable read-only links for travel companions without requiring recipient accounts.

**FR7:** The system shall support chat-based itinerary refinement for hotel changes, neighborhood preferences, dietary restrictions, and activity adjustments.

**FR8:** The system shall implement magic link authentication for secure, frictionless user sessions with itinerary history storage and retrieval.

**FR9:** The system shall flag and prevent hallucinated recommendations, maintaining <5% user-reported inaccuracy rate for places, hours, and availability.

**FR10:** The system shall generate walkable, time-aware itinerary sequences that maximize weekend time efficiency and minimize travel friction between activities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime with graceful degradation when individual agents fail, ensuring continuous service availability.

**NFR2:** The Validation Agent shall catch >95% of hallucination attempts before recommendations reach users, maintaining quality assurance standards.

**NFR3:** LLM API costs shall remain below 30% of revenue as the system scales, ensuring sustainable cost structure.

**NFR4:** The mobile experience shall support >85% of itinerary views with >4.2/5 mobile UX rating for on-the-go travel consumption.

**NFR5:** The system shall complete user flows from requirements input to exportable itinerary in under 5 minutes for optimal user experience.

**NFR6:** All user data and itinerary content shall be encrypted in transit and at rest, complying with standard data protection practices.

**NFR7:** The system shall handle concurrent user sessions during peak travel planning periods (Friday evenings, Sunday nights) without performance degradation.

**NFR8:** API integrations with external services (Google Places, Maps) shall include proper rate limiting and error handling to prevent service disruptions.
