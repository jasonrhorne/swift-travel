## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Data entity relationships need detailed schema design for complex itinerary storage
- Multi-agent coordination patterns require architectural deep-dive
- LLM cost modeling needs specific usage projections

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- Performance testing strategy for 20-second processing requirement
- Specific accessibility testing protocols beyond WCAG AA compliance
- Error recovery scenarios for multi-agent coordination failures

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- Additional user persona validation methods
- Advanced personalization algorithm details (deferred to Phase 2)

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope is Well-Balanced:**
- ✅ Four epics deliver incremental value
- ✅ Each epic provides deployable functionality
- ✅ Cross-cutting concerns properly integrated
- ✅ Clear boundaries between MVP and future features

**No Features to Cut:** All included features directly support core value proposition

**No Missing Essential Features:** Comprehensive coverage of user journey from intake to export

**Complexity Concerns:** Multi-agent orchestration is inherently complex but manageable with Cardinal's foundation

**Timeline Realism:** Achievable with proper technical architecture

## Technical Readiness

**Strengths:**
- Clear technology stack decisions (Node.js/TypeScript, React/Next.js)
- Proper consideration of external API integration
- Good separation of concerns in architecture approach

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
- Specific multi-agent state management patterns
- Database schema for complex itinerary relationships
- LLM prompt optimization strategies
- Real-time processing pipeline design

## Recommendations

**To Address High Priority Issues:**
1. **Data Schema Design:** Architect should design detailed entity relationships for users, itineraries, activities, and validation results
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Deep-dive into coordination patterns, state management, and error handling between agents
3. **Cost Modeling:** Create specific projections for LLM API usage across different user load scenarios

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add specific performance testing approach for 20-second requirement
- Include detailed accessibility testing checklist
- Expand error recovery scenarios documentation

**Next Steps:**
1. Output complete PRD document to docs/prd.md
2. Create architect and UX expert prompts for next phase
3. Begin architectural design with focus on multi-agent coordination and data modeling
