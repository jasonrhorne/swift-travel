# Risk Profile: Story 1.5

Date: 2025-09-17
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 88/100 (good)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## High Priority Risks

### 1. [PERF-001]: SSE Connection Management
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - EventSource connections can fail or timeout
**Impact**: Medium - User loses progress visibility but itinerary still generates

**Mitigation**:
- Automatic reconnection logic is implemented with 5-second retry
- Fallback polling mechanism via refresh button
- Connection error handling provides user guidance

**Testing Focus**: SSE connection failures, reconnection scenarios, fallback behaviors

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- SSE connection failure and recovery scenarios
- Network interruption during progress tracking
- EventSource cleanup on component unmount
- Fallback mechanisms when SSE fails

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- API timeout handling with proper error messages
- Mobile responsive behavior across device sizes
- Error boundary activation and recovery flows
- Performance monitoring data collection

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Component state management edge cases
- UI interaction patterns and animations
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None identified - all high risks are adequately mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-001: SSE failures handled with reconnection and fallback
- All other risks have appropriate mitigation strategies

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: User abandonment - acceptable as generation time is optimized
- TECH-001: Minor performance impacts from React re-renders are within acceptable bounds

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- SSE connection success/failure rates
- Progress tracking completion rates  
- Error boundary activation frequency
- User journey abandonment rates
- Component performance metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- SSE infrastructure changes
- New progress tracking features added
- Performance requirements change
- Error handling patterns evolve
- User behavior analytics show new patterns
