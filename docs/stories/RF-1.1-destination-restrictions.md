# Story 1.1: Restrict Destinations to US/Canada

## User Story
**As a** product owner  
**I want** to limit destination selection to US and Canada locations only  
**So that** we can provide higher quality, focused content for our target market

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Destination input accepts only US and Canada cities/regions
- [ ] Popular destinations show only US/Canada options
- [ ] Validation prevents non-US/Canada entries  
- [ ] Existing global destinations in database remain readable but not selectable

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- `/apps/web/src/components/forms/steps/DestinationStep.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/stores/requirementsStore.ts`
- `/packages/shared/src/schemas/requirements.ts`
- `/apps/web/src/lib/api/itinerary.ts`

### Implementation Steps
1. Update destination validation schema in shared package
2. Create US/Canada city list constant
3. Modify DestinationStep component to filter suggestions
4. Update popular destinations list
5. Add validation to prevent non-US/Canada entries
6. Update tests for new validation rules

## Integration Verification
- [ ] IV1: Existing destination search functionality continues to work with filtered dataset
- [ ] IV2: Form validation still triggers appropriately with new constraints
- [ ] IV3: Page load time remains within 10% of current performance

## Dependencies
- None (can be implemented first)

## Estimated Effort
- 4 hours

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for destination validation
- Component tests for DestinationStep
- E2E test for form submission with US/Canada destinations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully restricts destinations to US/Canada with proper validation and user-friendly suggestions. The code demonstrates good practices including input sanitization, debouncing for performance, and clear separation of concerns. The destination data module provides a comprehensive list of North American cities with search capabilities.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - implementation follows good practices and is well-structured.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized in shared package and component structure
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing dedicated unit tests for new validation functions
- All ACs Met: Partial - Core functionality implemented but test coverage incomplete

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add unit tests for `isValidNorthAmericanDestination` function
- [ ] Add unit tests for `getDestinationSuggestions` function
- [ ] Create component tests for DestinationStep validation behavior
- [ ] Add E2E tests for the complete destination selection flow
- [ ] Consider implementing fuzzy search for better user experience

### Security Review

Input sanitization is properly implemented with XSS protection through `sanitizeStringInput`. The validation regex prevents injection attacks by limiting allowed characters.

### Performance Considerations

- Debouncing (300ms) implemented to prevent excessive validation calls
- Suggestion list limited to 8 results for optimal performance
- Efficient filtering algorithm for destination suggestions

### Files Modified During Review

None - code quality meets standards, only test coverage needs improvement.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/RF-1.1-destination-restrictions.yml
Risk profile: Low-Medium (missing test coverage)
NFR assessment: Security PASS, Performance PASS, Reliability CONCERNS, Maintainability PASS

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Add missing test coverage before marking as Done

**Key Issues:**
1. No dedicated unit tests for the destination validation functions in `packages/shared/src/data/destinations.ts`
2. Component test file exists but only contains mocks, no actual validation tests
3. Acceptance criteria 3 and 4 lack test verification

The implementation itself is solid, but comprehensive test coverage is essential for maintaining reliability and preventing regression.
