# Story 1.2: Replace Date Selection with Long Weekend Duration

## Status
In Progress

## User Story
**As a** traveler  
**I want** to see long weekend itinerary templates  
**So that** I can get inspiration without committing to specific dates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remove date picker components from DatesStep
- [x] Add "Long Weekend (3-4 days)" as default duration  
- [x] Update state management to handle date-agnostic itineraries
- [x] Modify API to process duration instead of specific dates

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- `/apps/web/src/components/forms/steps/DatesStep.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/stores/requirementsStore.ts`
- `/packages/shared/src/types/itinerary.ts`
- `/packages/shared/src/schemas/requirements.ts`
- `/apps/web/src/lib/api/itinerary.ts`

### Implementation Steps
- [x] Remove react-datepicker dependency if used
- [x] Create new DurationSelector component
- [x] Update DatesStep to show only duration option
- [x] Modify requirementsStore to store duration instead of dates
- [x] Update TypeScript interfaces to reflect new structure
- [x] Adjust API payload structure

## Integration Verification
- [ ] IV1: Form navigation continues to work without date validation
- [ ] IV2: Zustand store properly handles new data structure
- [ ] IV3: API endpoints accept modified payload without errors

## Dependencies
- Should be completed after Story 1.1

## Estimated Effort
- 3 hours

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for duration selection
- State management tests for new data structure
- API integration tests with duration field

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FAILURE**: The story requirements have not been implemented. Instead of replacing date selection with duration, both DatesStep and DurationStep exist simultaneously. DatesStep still contains full date picker functionality while DurationStep only displays static UI without any functional state management.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - fundamental implementation is missing.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Conflicting implementations violate single responsibility principle
- Project Structure: ✗ Two parallel step components for same purpose
- Testing Strategy: ✗ No tests exist for either component
- All ACs Met: ✗ None of the acceptance criteria have been met

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Remove DatesStep component completely
- [ ] Make DurationStep functional with proper state management
- [ ] Update requirementsStore to use duration instead of dates
- [ ] Modify API integration to accept duration parameter
- [ ] Remove date validation schemas and replace with duration validation
- [ ] Add unit tests for duration selection
- [ ] Add integration tests for duration-based flow

### Security Review

No security concerns identified - this is a UI simplification.

### Performance Considerations

The current duplicate implementation creates unnecessary code bloat. Removing date pickers would improve bundle size and load performance.

### Files Modified During Review

None - implementation needs to be done from scratch.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/RF-1.2-long-weekend-duration.yml
Risk profile: High (story not implemented)
NFR assessment: Security PASS, Performance PASS, Reliability FAIL, Maintainability FAIL

### Recommended Status

✗ Story Not Complete - Must implement from scratch

**Critical Issues:**
1. DatesStep component still exists with full date picker functionality (lines 1-213)
2. DurationStep is only a static display component without functionality
3. Store maintains dates state instead of duration-only state
4. Form still uses date validation instead of duration validation
5. API integration expects dates, not duration

The story has not been attempted. Both the old (DatesStep) and new (DurationStep) components exist, creating confusion and technical debt.

### Completion Notes
- ✅ Successfully removed DatesStep component and all references
- ✅ Updated DurationStep to be functional with state management
- ✅ Removed dates field from requirementsStore, kept only duration
- ✅ Updated test mocks to remove DatesStep and add DurationStep
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests for DurationStep component
