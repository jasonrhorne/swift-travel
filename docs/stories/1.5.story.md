## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion notes:
- Performance monitoring system is in place with 2-second API timeout targets
- Requirements intake form successfully integrates with orchestration system
- Test infrastructure improvements were made to support integration testing
- API timeout configuration prevents poor UX from slow requests

### Data Models
**Itinerary Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Itinerary]:
```typescript
interface Itinerary {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  destination: Destination;
  persona: PersonaType;
  status: ItineraryStatus;
  activities: Activity[];
  metadata: ItineraryMetadata;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Activity {
  id: string;
  itineraryId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: ActivityCategory;
  timing: ActivityTiming;
  location: ActivityLocation;
  validation: ValidationResult;
  personaContext: PersonaContext;
}

interface ActivityTiming {
  dayNumber: number; // 1-based day within itinerary
  startTime: string; // ISO time string
  duration: number; // minutes
  flexibility: 'fixed' | 'flexible' | 'weather-dependent';
  bufferTime: number; // minutes for transitions
}

type ProcessingStatus = 
  | 'initiated' 
  | 'research-in-progress' 
  | 'research-completed'
  | 'curation-in-progress'
  | 'curation-completed'
  | 'validation-in-progress'
  | 'validation-completed'
  | 'response-in-progress'
  | 'completed'
  | 'failed';
```

### API Specifications

**Progress Event Format** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#SSE]:
```
event: progress
data: {"stage": "research-in-progress", "message": "Discovering unique experiences in Paris...", "progress": 25}

event: completed
data: {"itineraryId": "uuid", "message": "Your personalized itinerary is ready!", "progress": 100}
```

- Error Handling: Structured logging and user-friendly messages

### Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Component tests: `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/itinerary/`
- Hook tests: `apps/web/src/__tests__/hooks/`
- E2E tests: `e2e/specs/itinerary.spec.ts`

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for ItineraryCard and ActivityCard components
