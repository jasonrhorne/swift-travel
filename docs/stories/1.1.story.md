### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Extensions**: uuid-ossp, postgis
- **Core Tables**: users, itineraries, activities, itinerary_requests, share_tokens
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with proper policies
- **Performance**: Proper indexing on user_id, status, created_at fields
- **Constraints**: Enum checks for status and category fields

### Development Workflow
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- **Commands**: `npm run dev` (all services), `npm run test`, `npm run build`
- **Environment Files**: .env.local (frontend), .env (functions)
- **Required APIs**: Supabase, OpenAI, Google Places, Google Maps, Upstash Redis

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- **Testing Pipeline**: lint, type-check, unit tests, function tests, e2e tests
- **Deployment**: Automatic preview for PRs, production deployment on main branch
- **Build Commands**: `npm run build:web`, `npm run build:functions`

### Security and Performance Standards
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- **Bundle Size Target**: <500KB initial, <100KB per route
- **Security**: CSP headers, input validation with Zod, rate limiting
- **Performance**: <2s per function, proper caching strategies

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Tests**: `apps/web/src/__tests__/` (components, hooks, pages, utils)
- **Backend Tests**: `apps/functions/src/__tests__/` (agents, auth, integration)
- **E2E Tests**: `e2e/specs/` (user journey, agent pipeline, error scenarios)

### File Locations for New Code
- **Frontend Components**: `apps/web/src/components/`
- **Backend Functions**: `apps/functions/src/`
- **Shared Types**: `packages/shared/src/types/`
- **Database Schemas**: `packages/database/src/schemas/`
- **Agent Logic**: `packages/agents/src/`

### Technical Constraints
- **Node.js Version**: 20.0.0+ required for Netlify Functions
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, shared types between frontend/backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for complex data structures
- **Serverless**: All backend functions must be stateless and fast (<2s)

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Locations**: 
  - Frontend: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`
  - Backend: `apps/functions/src/__tests__/`
  - E2E: `e2e/specs/`
- **Framework**: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- **Standards**: Each component/function requires corresponding test file
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all packages

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Quality Assessment Summary

**INFRASTRUCTURE FOUNDATION SOLID** with some build and testing gaps that should be addressed before proceeding to subsequent stories.

### Implementation Status Analysis
- **Monorepo Structure**: ✅ Complete - all workspaces configured correctly
- **Development Tooling**: ✅ Complete - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, testing framework
- **Database Schema**: ✅ Complete - comprehensive schema documented and configured
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: ✅ Complete - GitHub Actions workflows implemented
- **Environment Management**: ✅ Complete - comprehensive .env.example with all required variables
- **Monitoring Setup**: ✅ Complete - Sentry and Pino logging integration
- **Docker Configuration**: ✅ Complete - development containers configured
- **Build Process**: ⚠️ **Issues Found** - TypeScript build failing

### Requirements Traceability
**Successfully Met (6/8 ACs):**
- AC1: Monorepo structure ✅ 
- AC2: Development environment ✅
- AC3: Database setup ✅ 
- AC4: Redis configuration ✅
- AC7: Environment configuration ✅
- AC8: Monitoring infrastructure ✅

**Partially Met (2/8 ACs):**
- AC5: Docker containerization ✅ (configured) ⚠️ (build issues)
- AC6: CI/CD pipeline ✅ (implemented) ⚠️ (likely failing due to build)

### Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk Factors:**
- Build failures will block development workflow
- No baseline tests to validate infrastructure works
- Subsequent stories depend on clean build process

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **Empty src directories** causing TypeScript compilation errors
2. **Missing smoke tests** for infrastructure validation
3. **Build process needs refinement** for empty workspace handling

### Recommendations
1. **NEXT SPRINT:** Add placeholder files or adjust tsconfig patterns
2. **BEFORE STORY 1.2:** Create basic infrastructure smoke tests
3. **PROCESS:** Establish build validation in story completion criteria
4. **MONITORING:** Validate Sentry/logging integration with test events

### Positive Highlights
- Comprehensive architecture documentation alignment
- All major infrastructure components properly configured  
- Environment management follows security best practices
- Monitoring and logging foundation excellent
