## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 1.3 completion]
- **Multi-Agent System Ready**: Complete orchestration engine operational with all 4 agents functional and processing pipeline established
- **Redis State Management**: Agent coordination infrastructure working with 20-second timeout monitoring
- **Internal Authentication**: X-Internal-Token security established for agent communication
- **API Foundation**: Processing endpoint `/itineraries/process-request` ready to receive user requirements
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Workspace imports configured for `@swift-travel/shared` packages

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **UserRequirements Interface**: Form must capture `destination: string`, `persona: PersonaType`, `dates: {startDate: Date, endDate: Date}`, `budgetRange: BudgetRange`, `groupSize: number`, `specialRequests: string[]`, `accessibilityNeeds: string[]`
- **PersonaType Enum**: `'photography' | 'food-forward' | 'architecture' | 'family'`
- **BudgetRange Enum**: `'budget' | 'mid-range' | 'luxury' | 'no-limit'`
- **ItineraryRequest Interface**: Form submission creates ItineraryRequest with `userId`, `requirements: UserRequirements`, `status: ProcessingStatus` starting as `'initiated'`

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **React Components**: Create in `apps/web/src/components/forms/` following PascalCase naming convention
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for form state with proper TypeScript patterns
- **Real-time Progress**: Prepare for Server-Sent Events integration for processing status updates
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes

### File Location Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Form Components**: `apps/web/src/components/forms/RequirementsIntakeForm.tsx`
- **Validation Schemas**: `packages/shared/src/validation/requirements.ts`
- **Zustand Stores**: `apps/web/src/stores/requirementsStore.ts`
- **API Services**: `apps/web/src/lib/api/itinerary.ts`
- **Unit Tests**: `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/forms/`

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router for routing and page structure
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI for accessible form components
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight form state management
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe validation shared between frontend/backend
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Define UserRequirements interface in `packages/shared/src/types` and import consistently
- **API Calls**: Use service layer in `apps/web/src/lib/api` - never direct HTTP calls in components
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects in `packages/shared/src/config`
- **State Updates**: Use proper Zustand patterns with immer for complex form state objects
- **Error Handling**: Implement user-friendly error messages with structured error handling

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Orchestration Endpoint**: Form submits to `/itineraries/process-request` with UserRequirements payload
- **Authentication**: Include user session JWT token for request authorization
- **Response Format**: Expect ItineraryRequest object with processing ID for status tracking
- **Error Handling**: Handle validation errors, rate limiting, and processing failures gracefully

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Unit Tests**: Component tests in `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/forms/`
- **Form Validation Tests**: Test validation schemas and error states
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG AA compliance testing with React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Form submission flow testing with mocked API responses
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library for consistent testing patterns

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Assessment Summary

**Implementation Quality**: The requirements intake form implementation is comprehensive and well-architected, with all acceptance criteria addressed through proper component structure, validation, accessibility features, and integration with the orchestration system.

**Key Strengths**:
- ✅ Complete multi-step form with mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Comprehensive Zod validation schemas with input sanitization  
- ✅ WCAG AA accessibility compliance implementation
- ✅ Proper state management with Zustand and localStorage persistence
- ✅ Clean API service layer for orchestration integration
- ✅ Good component separation and architecture

**Technical Debt Issues**:
- ⚠️ TypeScript compilation errors in functions test files
- ⚠️ Test suite failures due to outdated UserRequirements interface usage
- ⚠️ Missing ProcessingStatus export from shared package

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Fix TypeScript exports in `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` 
2. Update test files to use current UserRequirements schema (remove deprecated 'preferences' field)
3. Resolve compilation errors in functions package test files
4. Verify all tests pass before deployment

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-basic-requirements-intake-flow.yml

**Dev Instructions - Priority Fix Before Next Story:**

The customer-facing implementation is complete and functional. However, there are infrastructure issues that must be resolved before proceeding:

**What's Working:** 
- Requirements intake form is fully implemented and functional
- All acceptance criteria met with proper validation, accessibility, and integration
- Customer experience is ready for deployment

**What Needs Fixing (Est. 2-4 hours):**
1. **Missing Export:** Add `ProcessingStatus` to `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` exports
2. **Outdated Test Data:** Remove deprecated `preferences` field from test mocks in `apps/functions/src/__tests__/` 
3. **Schema Alignment:** Update test files to match current `UserRequirements` interface
4. **Verify:** Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` to confirm all issues resolved

**Business Impact:** Infrastructure debt that will cause problems if left unfixed. Core functionality is solid - this is maintenance to keep development process healthy.

### NFR Assessment Fixes Applied: 2025-09-16
