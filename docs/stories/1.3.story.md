# Story 1.3: Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system,  
**I want** to coordinate four specialized AI agents (Research, Curation, Validation, Response) in sequence,  
**so that** I can generate high-quality travel recommendations through collaborative AI processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Agent coordination framework with sequential processing pipeline
2. Research Agent implementation for destination discovery based on user requirements
3. Curation Agent implementation for itinerary creation with local context
4. Validation Agent implementation with basic Google Places API integration for verification
5. Response Agent implementation for user-friendly output formatting
6. Inter-agent data passing with proper error handling and state management
7. Processing time monitoring with alerts if coordination exceeds 20 seconds
8. Agent failure recovery mechanisms with graceful degradation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 1.2 completion]
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Workspace imports are configured for `@swift-travel/shared` packages with proper type sharing
- **Authentication Foundation**: JWT session management and user authentication are operational
- **Database Connection**: Supabase client setup and Redis configuration are working
- **Testing Patterns**: Vitest with proper mocking patterns established for Netlify Functions
- **Error Handling**: Structured logging with Pino and proper error response formats are in place

### Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Function Chaining Architecture**: Sequential pipeline with Redis state coordination to avoid 10-second Netlify timeout limits
- **Agent Communication**: Internal calls must use X-Internal-Token header for security
- **Processing Constraint**: Total pipeline must complete within 20 seconds with timeout monitoring
- **State Management**: Redis (Upstash) for agent coordination and inter-agent data passing

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **ItineraryRequest Interface**: Primary coordination object with `processingLog: AgentProcessingLog[]` and `status: ProcessingStatus`
- **ProcessingStatus Enum**: `'initiated' | 'research-in-progress' | 'research-completed' | 'curation-in-progress' | 'curation-completed' | 'validation-in-progress' | 'validation-completed' | 'response-in-progress' | 'completed' | 'failed'`
- **AgentProcessingLog Interface**: Track each agent execution with `agent`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `status`, `data`, `error`
- **Activity Interface**: Final output structure with `validation: ValidationResult` and `personaContext: PersonaContext`

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- **Agent Endpoints**: Internal functions at `/agents/research`, `/agents/curation`, `/agents/validation`, `/agents/response`
- **Authentication**: All internal agent calls require `X-Internal-Token` header security
- **Request Format**: Each agent receives `requestId: string (UUID)` and previous agent results
- **Response Format**: Each agent returns completion status and triggers next agent in chain

### File Location Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Agent Functions**: `apps/functions/src/agents/` for individual agent implementations
- **Orchestration Logic**: `packages/agents/src/orchestration/` for coordination utilities
- **Shared Types**: `packages/shared/src/types/` for inter-agent data structures
- **Integration Tests**: `apps/functions/src/__tests__/integration/` for pipeline testing

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js + Express for Netlify Functions compatibility
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for Research, Curation, and Response agents
- **External APIs**: Google Places API for Validation agent location verification
- **State Coordination**: Redis (Upstash) for serverless state management
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events for progress streaming to frontend

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Define agent interfaces in `packages/shared/src/types` and import consistently
- **Environment Variables**: Access OpenAI and Google API keys through config objects only
- **Error Handling**: Use standard error handler with structured logging for all agent functions
- **Async Operations**: All agent functions must update Redis state before triggering next agent
- **Database Access**: Use Data Access Layer for Supabase operations, never direct client imports

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Backend Unit Tests**: Individual agent tests in `apps/functions/src/__tests__/agents/`
- **Integration Tests**: Full pipeline tests in `apps/functions/src/__tests__/integration/`
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + Supertest for API and integration testing
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external APIs (OpenAI, Google Places) with proper error scenarios
- **Pipeline Validation**: Test agent coordination, state management, and timeout handling

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test File Locations:**
- Individual agent unit tests: `apps/functions/src/__tests__/agents/research.test.ts`, `curation.test.ts`, `validation.test.ts`, `response.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/functions/src/__tests__/integration/agent-pipeline.test.ts`
- End-to-end tests: `e2e/specs/agent-pipeline.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Backend: Vitest + Supertest for agent function testing
- E2E: Playwright for complete user journey validation

**Test Requirements:**
- Mock OpenAI GPT-4 API calls with realistic response data
- Mock Google Places API with valid/invalid location scenarios
- Test Redis state coordination between agents
- Test timeout scenarios and error recovery mechanisms
- Validate processing time stays under 20-second constraint
